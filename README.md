# Background Remover with U-Net

This repository contains an implementation of a background remover model using the U-Net architecture. The model is designed to accurately segment foreground objects and remove the background from images.

## Features

- **U-Net Architecture**: The model utilizes the U-Net architecture, which consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. This allows for effective feature extraction and preservation of fine details during the segmentation process.

- **Image Segmentation**: The model performs image segmentation to generate a binary mask, where foreground pixels (objects) are marked as 1 and background pixels are marked as 0. This mask can be used to separate the foreground from the background.

- **Training and Inference**: The repository provides scripts and utilities for training the model on custom datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model training. Inference scripts are also provided to easily apply the trained model for background removal on new images.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The repository includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model, such as intersection over union (IoU), pixel accuracy, and mean average precision (mAP).


## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make background removal more accessible and accurate together!
